# Community

The Community consists of several education institutions and suppliers that are working closely with SURF to further define and develop the Open Education API.

Community members are encouraged to share education data so that this information can be implemented in the Open Education API. This enables fast, efficient development of education apps, which benefits the members of the Community as well as their end-users.

* Possible future developments for the Open Education API.
