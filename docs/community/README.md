# Community

The Community consists of members (representatives) of education institutions and suppliers that are working closely with SURF to further define and develop the Open Education API.

Community members participate actively in the project and are encouraged to:

* share education data so that it can be implemented in the Open Education API.
* ask questions.
* propose potential modifications to the specification.
* provide feedback.
* contribute towards an active Community site.

This enables for fast, efficient development of education apps, which benefits the members of the Community as well as their end-users.

## Working group

The Working group is a subgroup of the Community and consists of a number of members that meet on a regular basis. The [Working group members](community/workinggroup/) are responsible for topics such as:

* the project roadmap.
* the design and future development of the Open Education API specification (the development has an annual cycle consisting of a minor and a major release).
* project management.
* the implementation of new data.
* evaluation of work done (new information implemented by SURF).
* the Community.
* promotion of the OOAPI.

The working group "way of working" is defined in the Governance model, which includes detailed information such as:

* Who can join the working group.
* A list of affiliated institutions.
* How to become a member of the working group.
* How to terminate membership of the working group.
* Rights and obligations of a working group member.

## Decisions within GitHub

TBD: The following text is based on source text from: [https://openonderwijsapi.nl/community/](https://openonderwijsapi.nl/community/ "https://openonderwijsapi.nl/community/")  
Please check if the assumptions below are correct. I think, by the way, that this information belongs under the heading Governance. JH

For issues that affect the GitHub environment ([https://github.com/open-education-api](https://github.com/open-education-api "https://github.com/open-education-api")), the following applies:

* The master committer then has 5 days to reach a decision.
* The decision is recorded within the GitHub environment.
* The voting procedure is started within these 5 days so that the decision can be voted on.
* The outcome of the vote is recorded.
