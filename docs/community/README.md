# Community

The Community consists of several education institutions and suppliers that are working closely with SURF to further define and develop the Open Education API.

Community members are encouraged to share education data so that this information can be implemented in the Open Education API. This enables fast, efficient development of education apps, which benefits the members of the Community as well as their end-users.

If you wish to join the Community and stay informed of the latest developments, please click **here**.

## Working group

The working group within the Community meet on a regular basis to discuss topics such as:

* Possible future developments for the Open Education API.
* The implementation of new data.
* Evaluation of work done (new information implemented by SURF).

The way of working is defined in the Governance model, which includes detailed information such as:

* Who can join the working group.
* A list of affiliated institutions.
* How to become a member of the working group.
* How to terminate membership of the working group.
