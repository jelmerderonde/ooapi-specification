# Working group

The Working group is a subgroup of the Community and consists of a number of members that meet on a regular basis. The [Working group members](community/workinggroup/) are responsible for topics such as:

* the project roadmap.
* the design and future development of the Open Education API specification (the development has an annual cycle consisting of a minor and a major release).
* project management.
* the implementation of new data.
* evaluation of work done (new information implemented by SURF).
* promotion of the OOAPI.
* the Community.

The working group "way of working" is defined in the [Governance](governance/) model, which includes detailed information such as:

* who can join the working group.
* a list of affiliated institutions.
* how to become a member of the working group.
* how to terminate membership of the working group.
* rights and obligations of a working group member.

For more information on the Governance model, please access the [Governance](governance/) link.
