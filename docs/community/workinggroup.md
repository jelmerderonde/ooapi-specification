# Working group members

TBD:
In the table below:

* Check if members, including contact names, are up-to-date.
* Check if the links are correct (okay I think).
* Should list below be in a certain sequence (alphabetical for example)?
* Are these Community members or Working group members (affects title above and sentence below)? WE could have one combined table showing Community and Working group members. JH
