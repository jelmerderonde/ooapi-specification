# Working group

The Working group is a subgroup of the Community and consists of a number of members that meet on a regular basis. The [Working group members](community/workinggroup/) are responsible for topics such as:

* the project roadmap.
* the design and future development of the Open Education API specification (the development has an annual cycle consisting of a minor and a major release).
* project management.
* the implementation of new data.
* evaluation of work done (new information implemented by SURF).
* the Community.
* promotion of the OOAPI.

The working group "way of working" is defined in the Governance model, which includes detailed information such as:

* Who can join the working group.
* A list of affiliated institutions.
* How to become a member of the working group.
* How to terminate membership of the working group.
* Rights and obligations of a working group member.

For more information on the Governance model, please access the [Governance](https://app.forestry.io/sites/s8lgqhmtjiapha/#/sections/docs/docs/governance/) link.
