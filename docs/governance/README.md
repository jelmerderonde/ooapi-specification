# Governance

The governance model describes the decision-making process and the role of various members of the **Working group**, **Community** and **Bureau Edustandaard**. Amongst others, it outlines the strategic goals and procedures within the project, and provides an understanding of how the Open Education API is governed.

The shared goals of the governance model are:

* **Sustainability**: To ensure the sustainability and health of the project and the Community.
* **Structure**: To provide structure to the organization so that the decision-making process is clear.
* **Transparency**: To provide transparency to the Community about the participation in and decision-making within the project;
* **Growth**: To provide a structure that can develop according to the needs of new adopters and developers, and that can support the Community.
* **Development**: To support effective development and maintenance of the Open Education API.
