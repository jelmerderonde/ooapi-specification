# Governance

TBD: This entire section has been updated on 09/09/2022, JH.

The governance model describes the decision-making process and the role of various members of the [Community](community/), [Working group](working group/), and [Bureau Edustandaard](https://www.edustandaard.nl/). It also outlines the strategic goals and procedures within the project, and provides an understanding of how the Open Education API is governed.

The shared goals of the governance model are:

* **Sustainability**: ensure the sustainability and health of the project and the Community.
* **Structure**: provide structure to the organization so that the decision-making process is clear.
* **Transparency**: provide transparency to the Community about the participation in and decision-making within the project;
* **Growth**: provide a structure that can develop according to the needs of new adopters and developers, and that can support the Community.
* **Development**: support effective development and maintenance of the Open Education API.

## Bureau Edustandaard

[Bureau Edustandaard](https://www.edustandaard.nl/) is a platform where public and private parties in the research and educational fields in the Netherlands collaborate to make agreements on important matters. These agreements, for example, include how to use recognized concepts to find digital learning material, or transfer education data from one system to another.

The Bureau Edustandaard platform ensures knowledge sharing, communication and interaction between services, systems, and organizations, which in turn improves the digital online experience of pupils, students and researchers alike.

Amongst others, Bureau Edustandaard:

* gives advice on specific standards for the research and educational sectors.
* manages agreements, architectures, and standards.
* manages the chain reference architecture [ROSA](https://rosa.wikixl.nl/) for the entire education domain.
* safeguards the agreed standards.

Collaboration within Bureau Edustandaard takes place within:

* the **Standardization council** (a council consisting of directors of educational institutions, public and private organizations),
* the **Architecture council**, and
* the **Edustandaard working groups**.

To achieve their goals the bureau also maintains contact with other (national and international) standards organizations.

## Bureau Edustandaard and the OOAPI

For the Open Education API, Bureau Edustandaard:

* give advice on and manage the standardization of the OOAPI.
* ensure that the OOAPI conforms with other standards in the context of ROSA by means of a ROSA scan.
* inform the Community about updates and changes to the OOAPI.
* publish all relevant information concerning the OOAPI on the [Bureau Edustandaard website](https://www.edustandaard.nl/), including the OOAPI specification, updates and changes to the OOAPI, and formal documentation.

## Decisions within GitHub

For issues that affect the GitHub environment ([https://github.com/open-education-api](https://github.com/open-education-api "https://github.com/open-education-api")), the following applies:

* The issue should be submitted to the master committer.
* The master committer then has 5 days to reach a decision.
* The decision is recorded within the GitHub environment.
* The voting procedure is started within these 5 days so that the decision can be voted on.
* The outcome of the vote is recorded.
* Any follow-up action is taken depending on the outcome of the vote.
