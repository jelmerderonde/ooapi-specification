# Governance

The governance model defines how the **Working group** in cooperation with **Bureau Edustandaard** hold themselves accountable to the **Community**. Amongst others, it outlines the strategic goals, roles, procedures, and decision-making process within the project, and provides an understanding of how the  Open Education API is governed.

The shared goals of the governance model are to provide:

•	Sustainability: Ensure the sustainability and health of the project and the community;

•	Structure: Provide structure in the organisation so that the decision-making process is clear;

•	Transparency: Provide transparency to the community on communication about, participation in and decision-making within the project;

•	Growth: Provide for a structure that can grow in the shape of new adopters and developers, and that can support the community;

•	Development: Support effective development and maintenance of the Open Education API.
