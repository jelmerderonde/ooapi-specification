# Open Education API

Have you considered using a standard API (Application Programming Interface), such as the Open Education API, to improve the IT infrastructure of your school, college, or university? There are some very good reasons for doing this…

Not only does the Open Education API enhance the digital, online experience of students participating in your study programs, but it offers a significant number of advantages for your software development team as well.

Let’s take a closer look...

## What is the Open Education API?

Educational institutes are increasingly using apps to share education data with their students. However, the underlying data for these apps are stored in different systems (i.e. databases), both within and outside the educational institutes. For existing and new apps to communicate with these various systems, a set of software definitions known as an API is required.

Of course, each school, college, or university can develop their own APIs, but this is a time-consuming and costly process. That is why SURF are collaborating with several education institutes and suppliers in the Netherlands (collectively known as the Community) to create the Open Education API, known in Dutch as the ‘Open Onderwijs API’ or in short, the OOAPI.

This open API (or public API as it is sometimes referred to) is constantly being defined and developed so that existing and new apps can efficiently process education data, such as registering for a course online, viewing a timetable on a mobile device, or securely checking exam results.

For a brief introduction to the OOAPI, please take a look at the short video below:

## What are the benefits of using the Open Education API?

By incorporating the OOAPI into your IT infrastructure, students can easily:

* Use a smartphone to find the nearest unoccupied computer.
* Conveniently use an app to check the status of study credits.
* Register online for a course or an exam.
* View class timetables on a smartphone. *
* Securely check exam results.*
* And more…
* To protect personal data such as exam results and timetables, it is advisable to use an authorization server that supports OAuth 2.0 in combination with SURFconext. These security measurements are not included in the OOAPI, but their use is supported.

## The benefits for your web-development team include:

* Fast development times due to standardisation.
* No major cost/investment required.
* Easier to exchange data with other educational institutes.
* No need to develop individual, bespoke APIs.
* Convenient reuse of third-party apps across multiple educational institutes.
* Safe sharing of information in a trusted environment.
* Continuous knowledge sharing thanks to collaboration with other educational institutes.

## Our mission

It is our goal at SURF to continually define and further develop the OOAPI, in close cooperation with the Community, and in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Governance model, so that it can be used by as many schools, colleges, and universities in the Netherlands as possible.

Furthermore, educational institutes that want to publish education data in a standardised way can implement their own API, based on the OOAPI standard.

## Working together to create a standard

Apps are constantly evolving…

To create an all-encompassing, standard API, it is essential to understand the ever-changing needs of the various educational institutes. That is why we place great value on the role of the community. We believe that by working together, we can create a standard API (the OOAPI) that best serves all students in the Netherlands.

## An example of how the OOAPI can benefit the community

Both the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the Zuyd Hogeschool use the OOAPI on a daily basis as part of their IT infrastructure.
The MijnUvA app, as used by students at the UvA, combines data from the electronic learning environment, the student information system, the timetable system, and the UvA website. By using the OOAPI, these data can be accessed and presented in a clear and organised way.

When the Zuyd Hogeschool decided to develop a new intranet for their students, to save time and money, the OOAPI was the obvious choice as a major building block for their IT infrastructure.

## Interview with Johannes Maas (Director of innovation at Finalist, and involved with the implementation of the OOAPI at Zuyd Hogeschool)

“The OOAPI translates information from existing source systems and makes it available for educational apps. Take for example a new app that allows you to view the class timetable on your smartphone or reserve a workspace while heading into work on the train. The existing systems supply the underlying information, but the functionality and display are new. By using the OOAPI to unlock the existing systems, a comprehensive range of new apps can be developed. And moreover, this can be achieved without having to adapt the source systems themselves.”
