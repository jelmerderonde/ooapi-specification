# Open Education API

Educational institutes are increasingly sharing educational data: with their students using apps, within the institution between different systems, or with other institutions. The underlying data, however, for these apps are stored in different systems (i.e. databases), both within and outside the educational institutes. And for apps to communicate with these various systems, a set of definitions known as an [API (Application Programming Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) is required.

Of course, each school, college, or university can develop their own APIs, but this is a time-consuming and costly process. That is why the Open Education API, known in Dutch as the ‘Open Onderwijs API’ (OOAPI) was created. This [open API](technical/), (or public API) is the result of a collaboration between several education institutes and suppliers in the Netherlands and is facilitated by [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/) (collectively known as the [Community](community/)).

The OOAPI conforms to the design principles of [REST](technical/) (Representational State Transfer) - a flexible, lightweight way of integrating applications. Within the Community, the OOAPI is constantly being defined and developed so that new and existing apps can efficiently process education data as required.

For a brief introduction to the OOAPI, please take a look at the short video below:

## Benefits for students

By incorporating the OOAPI into your IT infrastructure, students can easily:

* Use a smartphone to find the nearest unoccupied computer.
* Conveniently use an app to check the status of study credits.
* Register online for a course or an exam.
* View class timetables on a smartphone. *
* Securely check exam results.*
* And more…

\* To protect personal data such as exam results and timetables, it is advisable to use an authorization server that supports OAuth 2.0 in combination with SURFconext. These security measurements are not included in the OOAPI, but their use is advised.

## Benefits for web-development team

* Fast development times due to standardization.
* No major cost/investment required.
* Easier to exchange data with other educational institutes.
* No need to develop individual, bespoke APIs.
* Convenient reuse of third-party apps across multiple educational institutes.
* Safe sharing of information in a trusted environment.
* Continuous knowledge sharing thanks to collaboration with other educational institutes.

## Creating a standard together

Apps are constantly evolving…

To create an all-encompassing, standard API, it is essential to understand the ever-changing needs of the various educational institutes. Therefore, the [Community](community/) places great value on working closely together to create a standard API (the OOAPI) that best serves as many educational institutes in the Netherlands as possible.

Furthermore, educational institutes that want to publish education data in a standardized way can implement their own API, based on the OOAPI standard.

## Interested in joining us?

Are you an educational institute and interested in having the OOAPI developed to suit your needs? Then why not join us. For more information, please access the [Community](community/) link.

## Case study

TBD: A better example of a cases study is required, for example RIO. JH
