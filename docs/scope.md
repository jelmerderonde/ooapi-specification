# OOAPI implementations

The OOAPI workgroup is comprised of members of institutions for higer education, software suppliers of these members, as well as supra-sectoral (e.g. VH / VSNU). Currently the OOAPI is implemented at: universities for applied sciences, universities and super sectoral. An example of the latter is a tool implemented for the acceleration [zone flexible education](https://versnellingsplan.nl/english/zones/flexibilisation/).

The working group is also open for other members of other educational sectors.

Due to the scope of SURF these sectors are now limited to intermediate vocational education and Higher education (MBO/HBO, WO en UMC's). For other sectors to join the governance of the workgroup would need to be updated.
