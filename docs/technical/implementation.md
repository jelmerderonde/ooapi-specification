# Steps to implement an OOAPI endpoint

1. Data modelling (locating authoritative sources, determining scope of OOAPI endpoint), mainly on the level of entities
2. Designing the endpoint (using a single source, ESB, etc)
3. Detailed information mapping, on the level of individual attributes
4. Technical realisation.
