# Profiles

Currently the OOAPI is used in several ways. Within institutions as an implementaiton to provide internal information to students, or as a canonical model to allow for exchange of information between internal systems within an institution. OOAPI is also used as a specification to allow communication within HE sector projects. Example of these: RIO, eduXchange and other developments are also on the way.

These projects sometimes have additional requirements for the information model in OOAPI. In some cases extra fields are needed, which can be coverd using the consumers. But in other cases existing fields are being made mandatory for the project to achieve its goals.

This is where specific profiles of the OOAPI come into play. The aim of this page is either to provide the profile itself or to direct to the profile information that is hosted on a different site.
